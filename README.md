====================

HOAM is designed primarily for single-family and condominium property management.

HOAM is intended to give owners living in a neighborhood or condominium building the tools they need to easily administer and operate an property owners association without the need for an outside management company, given a minimum amount of time. Indeed, HOAM is designed specifically to streamline and automate many of the operational tasks of running an HOA.
