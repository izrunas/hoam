2020/05/05 v0.886 release 2
============================

Fixes:
  Fixed minor issues with upgrade functions.


2020/05/05 v0.886
===================
! Please see the below change to invoice attachments -- if not using the new
! upgrade routine, you will need manually update your install.

Fixes:
  Fixed issues with date records from older releases that was set to
    '0000-00-00' originally but should now use '1970-01-01' (resulting from
    MySQL NO_ZERO_DATE changes).
  Fixed more PHP notices and warnings.

Additions:
  Added checkbox option on export to include attachments in backup.
  Added log class functions findMessage() and returnSequence().
  Added xml_version_check.php.
  Added check to daly maintenance script to make sure the system is not in
    maintenance mode when running.
  Added housekeeping checks for homeowner sale date and violation resolution
    date to update them to 1970-01-01 so they'll work correctly with new code.

Changes:
! Changed adding of vendor invoice attachments from reporting each charge as
    the owner to the invoice itself. This will cause a system previously in
    production to no longer find previously entered attachments. The upgrade
    routine will automatically update your database accordingly. If manually
    upgrading, you'll need to run save and manually run the PHP migration
    script in the upgrade.
  Changed backup process to overwrite zip archive contents if a backup file
    already exists.
  Moved Insurance maintenance routine into separate function.
  Minor documentation updates.
  Tidied up maintenance routine report slightly.
  Converted report.js, residenceBudgetView.js, residence_detail_user.js to use
    only JQuery.
	

2020/05/05 v0.885
===================
  This release includes the initial version of an automated upgrade process;
with any luck, v0.885 should be the last version requiring any manual changes
(however, there are a few below).

! Added new log flag for system upgrade messages, please set a value in the
! system configuration.

! A change must be made to the Apache RewriteRule on your system. Documentation
! has been updated accordingly. This will solve a problems with attachments not
! being downloaded correctly.
! Old:
!     RewriteRule !\.(css|gif|jpg|js|pdf|php|png)$ /index.php
! New:
!     RewriteRule /$ /index.php

! The cURL and Zip modules are now required by HOAM, you'll need to install it
! during the upgrade by running:
!
! sudo apt-get install php-zip php-curl
! sudo service apache2 restart
!
! or the equivilent commands for your Linux distribution or operating system.

Fixes:
  Found and fixed two more errors caused by MySQL ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY mode.
  Fixed empty HTML string displaying attachment list for properties for sale.
  Fixed links for php_info and hoam_info.
  Fixed violation edit_script allowing violations to be created without any
    selected categories.
  Fixed typos in xml_severity.php
  Fixed popup warning when entering a violation with no categories selected
    (believe this is due to the recent removal of windows_js).
  Fixed javascript form error messages that were broken when windows_js was
    removed.
  Fixed removal of multiple form error messages that could be left behind after
    an error was corrected
  Fixed several references to budget/flags/ignore_budget that should be

    page to be scrolled.

  Added new log flag for system upgrade messages.
  Added option to toggle maintenance mode to diag menu. There's not currently
    an easy way to turn off maintenance mode if you log out, so be careful.

    preview images. This is useful when changing the size of preview files, as
    the previews will not be regenerated in a new size if they already exist.

    sale, and work requests.
  Added configuration option for root article ID.

2020/04/30 v0.884
===================

    attachment is deleted.


2020/04/26 v0.883
===================
Fixes:
  Fixed debugging code left enabled in last release that prevents adding &
    modifying homeowners.

Additions:
  Added ability to report if there's a new version available (get latest
    version in during housekeeping routine, display an upgrade message on the
    website administraton page).
  Added missing configuration options for homeowner comments, and lot block,
    lot, plat, latitude, and longitude minimum lengths.

Other changes:

    specified in the configuration and not the organization's.
  Removed duplicate database connection attempt in db class.


2020/04/25 v0.882
===================
  Help popups have changed from Javascript to CSS, which will speed up page
loads and reduce the amount of data being transferred (by at least 200k per
page view). Due to the changes in how help is now displayed, there may be a few
empty popups that had information previously. These will be resolved in a
future release.
  You may also delete the now unused 3rdparty/windows_js directory.

! The violaton approval setting was renamed, make sure you go into the system
  configuration screen and re-enable this if needed.
! There is a new flag for homeowner_sale attachments, make sure you go into the
  configuration screen and set one. 
! Please run the below commands against your HOAM MySQL database:

DROP TABLE topics;
DELETE FROM configuration WHERE config_option="violation/flags/denied";
DELETE FROM configuration WHERE config_option="violation/flags/require_approval";
DELETE FROM configuration WHERE config_option="work_request/flags/denied";

  Fixed viewing of public budgets by residents and owners.
  Fixed remaining (broken) references to the old $_HOAM_language ['history']
    strings.
  Fixed edited work requests without a child disappearing -- this appears to
    be due to a behavior change in how either MySQL or PHP treat empty strings
    in the last few years. Made a couple other precautionary changes changing
    empty strings ('') to empty($var) calls.
  Fixed active work request list not showing requests in planning status.
  Fixed some more PHP warnings and notices.

2020/04/18 v0.88
==================
ARP Realty ceased operations in 2016, so not much has been done with this code
over the last 4+ years. One upside of being furloughed during the Coronavirus
pandemic in 2020 is free time to come back and work on HOAM again.

Changes and fixes due to languishing for 4+ years:
  Updated several dependencies (JQuery, PHPMailer, TCPDF) to their most recent
    legacy versions; the work necessary to upgrade to the latest versions has
     not been done yet.
  Updates for PHP 7.2 compatibility:
    Add version check to init for php7 extension changes (mysql, mysqli,
      mbstring).
    Removed deprecated each() calls throughout.
    Removed check for mysql extension, no longer being used.
    Fixed deprecation warnings for obj_xml.php
    Fixed warnings due to MYSQL_ASSOC constant deprecation.
  Enhanced error checking and fixes for initial installation script.
  Changed mysql grant syntax on installation to work with MySQL 8.0.
  Renamed table 'groups' to 'group_list' because of new keyword reservation in
    MySQL 8.0.2.
  Re-verified ability to successfully install and run under:
    Ubuntu 14.04
    Ubuntu 16.04
    Ubuntu 18.04
    Windows Server 2012
    Windows Server 2019

A number of small database changes, partly because it should have been that way
  originally, and partly for compliance with new configuration defaults (eg,
  NO_ZERO_DATE) in various distributions. You'll need to run the following
  commands in MySQL (please make sure you perform in order):

ALTER TABLE advertising MODIFY flags BIGINT(20) UNSIGNED NOT NULL DEFAULT 0;

ALTER TABLE work_requests MODIFY flags BIGINT(20) UNSIGNED NOT NULL DEFAULT 0;

* Updated default groups for each of the above group IDs
* Updated descriptions on built-in groups
* Changed work_request edit script to respect new groups

2015/08/29 v0.874
==================
* Started work on a basic installation script; it's still not working yet, but
  I've held back this release for way too long already trying to get it to a
  good state. It will eventually be fleshed out, but for now just does the bare
  minimums to get a working system, essentially does the first part of the
  initial installaton as described in the documentation

! Several new configuration options for tracking insurance policies have
  been created, you will need to enter values for those settings.
! It's necessary to create a new table to hold insurance records:

CREATE TABLE `insurance` (
  `id` varchar(32) NOT NULL,
  `user_id` varchar(32),
  `vendor_id` varchar(32),
  `policy_num` varchar (64),
  `policy_type` smallint unsigned,

  `comments` text,
  `flags` bigint unsigned default 0,
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`) );

! In preparation of changing to using PHP's built-in password_hash and
  password_verify functions, the size of the password field in the database
  needs to be increased. You'll need to do the following:

ALTER TABLE users MODIFY password VARCHAR(255);

2014/06/30 v0.867
==================
* Added basic email validation and password resetting
* Email validation will not be performed unless enabled in the
  configuration
! A new user flag has been created, it is necessary to enter a value in
  the system configuration.
! It's necessary to create a new table to hold email validation records:

CREATE TABLE `user_validation` (
  `id` varchar(32) NOT NULL,
  `user_id` varchar(32),
  `hash` varchar(32),
  `datecreated` datetime,
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
) ;

* Password resetting will fall back to just validating the security
  question if there is not an email address on file for the user
* If email validation is enabled new users will not automatically be
  added to the Registered Users group as before on account creation (they
  are added after validation)
* Any unused validation requests will be purged as part of the nightly
  maintenance routine
* Enhanced experience for users validating their disabled account

  groups
