      Dear {{HOMEOWNER_NAME}},<br />

      <p style="text-align: justify">{{ORG_NAME}}, of which you are a member, has just recently received information that you purchased the property located at {{HOMEOWNER_RESIDENCE}}. Normally when a property is sold, the Association is given notice by the Realtor and title company, but in certain circumstances, such as when resold by the federal government (i.e. HUD or VA), no such notification is provided.</p>
      <p style="text-align: justify">Because the Association was unaware of the ownership change, you have likely not received copies of the governing documents for the Association, which are normally provided at close. If you have not received your copy of the governing documents, please inform us so a copy can be mailed to you.</p>
      <p style="text-align: justify">Additionally, because of the late discovery of this ownership change, you have likely not received notices sent by the Association. As such, assessments for Association dues have accumulated, as well as fees related to the collection of those dues.</p>
      <p style="text-align: justify">The Association is willing to write off all fees related to collection once payment is received for the delinquent dues. As such, we have included with this letter an invoice for the Association dues assessments. Please send payment for the delinquent dues no later than {{DATE+45}}</p>
      <p style="text-align: justify">If you have any questions about this letter, the Association, or the delinquent Association dues assessments, please contact us at {{ORG_PHONE}} or {{ORG_EMAIL_MANAGEMENT}}.</p>
