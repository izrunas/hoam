<div class="letter-body">

<p>We have not received payment for the current Assessments for the property located at {{HOMEOWNER_RESIDENCE}}. Perhaps it was overlooked or is on its way to us now. If payment has already been made, please note the new balance on the account due to the lateness of payment.</p>
<p>The following paragraph is required by the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act to be printed on all late notice letters:</p>
<blockquote>This management company has been employed to collect the debt referenced below and all information obtained will be used for that purpose. The name of the creditor is {{ORG_NAME}}.</blockquote>
<p>Our records show an unpaid balance on your account of {{BUDGET_DUE}}. {{ORG_NAME}} relies on your prompt payment of assessments so that it may meet its obligations in a timely manner. Please forward your payment immediately.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about the amount you owe, please call us at {{ORG_PHONE}} or send an email to {{ORG_EMAIL_MANAGEMENT}}. If you are currently unable to pay this debt, the Board of Directors has authorized us to offer you a payment plan. Please see the Payment Plan document available on the Association's web site ({{WEBSITE_DOMAIN}}). Additionally, if you or your spouse is an active military service member you may have additional rights under the Servicemember's Civil Relief Act.</p>
<p>Please do not ignore this notice; doing so will cause additional fees to accrue on your account.</p>
