<div class="letter-body">

<p>We have received the refinance documentation request for {{HOMEOWNER_RESIDENCE}}. A refinance documentation packet will need to be obtained from the HOA's management company before a residence can be refinanced. Your title company is aware of this, and normally they will request it for you.</p>
    <ol style="list-style: lower-alpha">
      <li>The cost of the documentation packet is {{ORG_DOC_REFINANCE}}, and is available for pickup 7 days after payment has been received. Same- or next-day requests can be accommodated for an additional expedite fee of {{ORG_DOC_EXPEDITE}}.</li>
      <li><em>Ordering the documentation packet before finalizing your contract is not recommended. The documentation packet will expire and must be reordered after 30 days.</em></li>
    </ol>
  </li>
<p>Your account currently shows a balance of {{BUDGET_DUE}}, not including the {{ORG_DOC_REFINANCE}} resale documentation packet. The total amount (including the refinance documentation) of {{BUDGET_DUE+{{ORG_DOC_REFINANCE}}}} must be paid in full to the Association prior to the refinance date.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, please contact an agent of the Association at {{ORG_PHONE}} or {{ORG_EMAIL_MANAGEMENT}}.</p>
