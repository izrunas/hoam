<div class="letter-body">

<p>We noticed that you recently placed your residence for sale. We're sorry to see you go! As you go through the process of selling your residence, please be aware of the following items:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Realtors must limit their signs to one (1) sign on the property. No other signs are permitted for a property sale and any additional will be removed and discarded at your expense, <em>especially signs located on HOA common property</em>.</li>
  <li>The State of Texas requires resale documentation before sale of a property in a Homeowners Association. A resale documentation packet will need to be obtained from the HOA's management company. Your Realtor and title company are aware of this, and will normally request it for you.
    <ol style="list-style: lower-alpha">
      <li>The cost of the documentation packet is {{ORG_DOC_RESALE}}, and is available for pickup 7 days after payment has been received. Same- or next-day requests can be accommodated for an additional expedite fee of {{ORG_DOC_EXPEDITE}}.</li>
      <li><em>Ordering the documentation packet before finalizing the resale contract is not recommended. The documentation packet will expire and must be reordered after 30 days.</em></li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Your account currently shows a balance of {{BUDGET_DUE}}, not including the {{ORG_DOC_RESALE}} resale documentation packet. The total amount (including the resale documentation) of {{BUDGET_DUE+{{ORG_DOC_RESALE}}}} must be paid in full to the Association prior to the sale date.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have any questions, please contact an agent of the Association at {{ORG_PHONE}} or {{ORG_EMAIL_MANAGEMENT}}.</p>
