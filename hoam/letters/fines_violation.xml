<p>Please note that you have been sent previous notices by the Association regarding a deed restriction violation that currently exists at your property. As part of the fine structure the Association has adopted regarding violations, you will be charged an escalating fine for each month that the issue remains unresolved.</p>
<p>These fines are a assessment owed to the Association, and the Association has the right to pursue collection as aggressively as required in order to collect the debt owed. The current fine structure has defined a maximum fine of $<span id="fine_amount"></span> per month until the violation is cured.</p>
<p>There will be no further notices regarding the fine structure. If you have any questions, please contact the Association at {{ORG_PHONE}} or {{ORG_EMAIL_MANAGEMENT}}.</p>
