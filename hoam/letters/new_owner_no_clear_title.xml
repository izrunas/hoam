<div class="letter-body">

<p>After reviewing the records of the Association, we do not show that assessments owed by the previous owner of your residence were collected during the purchase / closing of your new home. It is the responsibility of the title company to collect all delinquent payments from the previous homeowner. Your assistance is required to collect this debt from the title company and previous homeowner; various privacy laws restrict the information available to the HOA.</p>
<p>We would like to work with you on this, and can provide you with all of the relevant documentation. It is very important to start this process as quickly as possible because the governing documents of the Association require any remaining unpaid funds owed to the Association to also become your personal debt and obligation.</p>
<p>Please contact us at {{ORG_PHONE}}, or send an email to {{ORG_EMAIL_MANAGEMENT}} as soon as possible. Please note, <strong>if we have not received a response from you by {{DATE+45}}</strong>, we are required by the governing documents to begin the collection of delinquent assessments from you.</p>
