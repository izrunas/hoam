<p>WHEREAS, the Texas Legislature passed House Bill 362 which amends Chapter 202 of the Texas Property Code by adding Section 202.010 which precludes associations from adopting or enforcing a complete prohibition on solar energy devices; and</p>

<p>WHEREAS, pursuant to Secton 202.010 of the Texas Property Code, the Board of Directors of {{ORG_NAME}} (the <q>Association</q>) is permitted to adopt certain limitations on solar energy devices.</p>

<p>NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS RESOLVED, in order to comply with Section 202.010 of the Texas Property Code, the Board of Directors hereby repeals any and all prior restrictions on solar energy devices contained in any governing documents of the Association which are inconsistent with the new law, and adopts the following guidelines to govern solar energy devices.</p>

					<li>does not conform to the slope of the roof and has a top edge that is not parallel to the roofline; or</li>
					<li>has a frame, a support bracket, or visible piping or wiring that is not in a silver, bronze, or black tone commonly available in the marketplace;</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
