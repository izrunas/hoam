<h2>{{LETTER_TOPIC}}</h2>

<p>WHEREAS, the Texas Legislature passed House Bill 3391 which amends Section 202.007(d) of the Texas Property Code which precludes associations from adopting or enforcing certain prohibitions or restrictions on rain barrels and rainwater harvesting systems; and</p>

<p>WHEREAS, pursuant to Section 202.007(d) of the Texas Property Code, the Board of Directors of {{ORG_NAME}} (the <q>Association</q>) is permitted to adopt specific limitations on rain barrels and rainwater harvesting systems.</p>

<p>NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS RESOLVED, in order to comply with Section 202.007(d) of the Texas Property Code, the Board of Directors of the Association adopts the following guidelines for rain barrels and rainwater harvesting systems.</p>

<ol style="list-style: upper-alpha">
	<li>An owner may not install a rain barrel or rainwater harvesting system if:
		<ol>
			<li>such device is to be installed in or on property:
				<ol style="list-style: lower-alpha">
					<li>owned by the Association;</li>
					<li>owned in common by the members of the Association; or</li>
					<li>located between the front of the owner's home and an adjoining or adjacent street; or</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>the barrel or system:
				<ol style="list-style: lower-alpha">
					<li>is of a color other than a color consistent with the color scheme of the owner's home; or</li>
					<li>displays any language or other content that is not typically displayed by such a barrel or system as it is manufactured.</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>The Association may regulate the size, type, and shielding of, and the materials used in the construction of a rain barrel, rainwater harvesting device, or other appurtenance that is located on the side of a house or at any other location that is visible from a street, another log, or a common area if:
		<ol>
			<li>the restriction does not prohibit the economic installation of the device or appurtenance on the owner's property; and</li>
			<li>there is a reasonably sufficient area on the owner's property in which to install the device or appurtenance.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>In order to enforce these regulations, an owner must receive written approval fomr the Board or the architectural control or review committee (if one exists) prior to installing any rain barrel or rainwater harvesting system. Accordingly, prior to installation, an owner must submit plans and specifications to and receive the written approval of the Board or architectural control/review committee. The plans and specifications must show the proposed location, color, material, shielding devices, size and type of such system or device (and all parts thereof). The plans should also identify whether the device or any part thereof will be visible from any street, other lot or common area.</li>
	<li>The definitions contained in the Association's dedicatory instruments are hereby incorporated herein by reference.</li>
	<li>In the event of any conflict between the new law cited above and any restrictions contained in the governing document of the Association, including design guidelines, policies and the Declaration, the new law and this Rainwater Collection Device Policy control.</li>
